# Liana Principe - Data Analysis Portfolio
### About
Hi, I'm Liana! I have a Bachelor's degree in statistical mathematics and technological experience working with SQL, Python, R, Advanced Excel, and Tableau. I am passionate about analyzing data to extract insightful information that can be used to promote positive changes. I have worked with data in the tech field, media, marketing, retail, and business sector. I am currently in a media field, but am always searching for additional ways that data can be applied to impact our world today.

This repository displays only some of my projects across a wide assortment of Data Analyst/Data Science topic. You can check out my other projects at the links below. Feel free to contact me with any questions!
